# I <3 Ice Cream is a creamery that makes delicious ice cream. They are growing rapidly, and they need some software to help them manage their kitchen.

# Your job is to build a program that will help them manage their ice cream freezing. Here are a few user stories to help get you started:

# Release 0 :Design the structure
# Think about this problem critically before you even begin to write code and describe how you would design the program in plain English.

# At the very least, consider these questions in your answer:

# What are essential classes?
# What attributes will each class have?
# What interface will each class provide?
# How will the classes interact with each other?
# Which classes will inherit from others, if any?
# Implement a minimum viable product.

# It does not need to track multiple types of ice cream, but you should be able to move ice cream into and out of a freezer. This would be a great time to write some tests in the spec file that show how you'd like your classes to work, and then get them all to pass!





# Will you need other classes? What attributes will those classes have?
# How will classes talk to each other?
